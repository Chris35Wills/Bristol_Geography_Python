# Bristol_Geography_Python

Welcome to the Bristol Geography Python User Group!

We meet every other week in the Bristol University Geography Department and offer an opportunity to share knowledge of the various packages we use, approaches to programmatic problems we take as well as a platform to ask questions about existing code and ideas to improve and advance our individual applications of the Python programming language.

However, the group is not just limited to Python users, with plenty of cross over extending to other scripting languages including R, Matlab, IDL etc. 

Feel free to come along and listen or join in the discussions.

If you'd like to get involved or present something, please email me: chris.williams@bristol.ac.uk
